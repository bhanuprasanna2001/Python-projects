# 1.1 Task Manager

Build a professional CLI based Task Manager.

Let's think what all needs to be implemented to have a Professional Task Manager.

First Goal:

1. CRUD operations:
    - Create - The program must be able to create tasks.
    - Read - The program must get all the tasks when required to view.
    - Update - The program must be able to get the task, then following with an update operation to update the task.
    - Delete - The program must be able to delete the task.

Second Goal:

2. How are we gonna do the CRUD operations:
    - First through JSON - add tasks, then list tasks would be the first to be implemented.
    - We will migrate from JSON to SQLite which would also include the learning of Databases. (Future goal)


Third Goal:

3. Implement basic features:
    - Currently we only have basic CRUD operations. But we must also add complete task. Error handling and Input Validation is also required.
    - Only CLI based application.

Fourth Goal:

4. Now advanced features:
    - Have priority levels (HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW).
    - Add due dates with datetime.
    - Add categories/tags.
    - Implement search via priority, date, or category.
    - Sort tasks based on criteria.

Fifth Goal and Final Goal:

5. Need to write tests and docstring for the project.


>I have successfully built the project, but still the TEST CASES is one thing which I am not at all able to figure out.
